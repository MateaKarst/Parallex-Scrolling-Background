# Parallex-Scrolling-Background
This project demonstrates a parallax scrolling background effect, where multiple layers of images move at different speeds to create a sense of depth as you adjust the game speed. The background consists of several layers, and the speed of movement can be controlled by a slider, offering a dynamic visual experience.

## How It Works
- Layer Speed Modifiers: Each background layer moves at a different speed, which creates a sense of depth.
- Slider Control: The slider allows you to adjust the speed of all the layers simultaneously, altering the pace of the animation.
